Welcome to my project showcase! Here you'll find detailed documentation of homelab solutions, containerization projects, and automation tools I've built. Each project includes implementation details, lessons learned, and practical insights from real-world deployment.

There is no rhythm or reason as to why I've included something here or not. These projects are a collection of interests I've had and have written something up for. They include automation, self-hosted solutions, and enthusiast solutions tailored for homelab implementations.
