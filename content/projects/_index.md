Welcome to my project showcase! Here you'll find detailed documentation of homelab solutions, containerization projects, and automation tools I've built. Each project includes implementation details, lessons learned, and practical insights from real-world deployment.

These projects represent my passion for practical automation, self-hosted solutions, and turning complex enterprise technologies into approachable homelab implementations.
