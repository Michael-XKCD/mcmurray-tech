Hello world! My name is **Michael McMurray**, and I'm a cybersecurity engineer with an obsession for containerization. I believe that containerization in the cloud is the future of computing and I'm passionate about learning everything. 

In addition to my technical expertise, I'm a people person and I take pride in my communication skills. I enjoy collaborating with others and am comfortable explaining complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences. Whether I'm working with colleagues on a project or engaging with clients, I always approach interactions with a friendly and positive attitude.
